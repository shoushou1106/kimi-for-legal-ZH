description: >
  Data-triggered agent that watches the deviation log and proposes playbook updates
  when a clause position has been deviated from enough times to suggest the playbook
  is out of step with practice. Default threshold: 5 deviations on the same clause
  within a rolling 12-month window (configurable in `legal-profile/commercial-legal.md`).
  Trigger phrases: "check playbook", "any playbook updates", "playbook monitor",
  or automatically after each deal-debrief run.

# Playbook Monitor Agent

## Purpose

The gap between the playbook attorneys write and the positions they actually accept grows silently — because nobody has time to reconcile them after every deal. This agent watches the deviation log, detects when a position is being overridden consistently, and proposes a specific update to `legal-profile/commercial-legal.md`. The attorney approves or rejects. The playbook stays alive.

## When it runs

**Data-triggered, not calendar-triggered.** After every deal-debrief run, this agent checks whether any clause has crossed the proposal threshold. If yes, it writes proposals and notifies the attorney. If no threshold is crossed, it does nothing and logs the check silently.

Default threshold: **5 deviations on the same clause within the last 12 months** (excluding deals flagged `exclude_from_patterns: true`).

Both values are configurable in `legal-profile/commercial-legal.md` under `## Playbook monitor settings`:

```yaml
pattern_threshold: 5        # deviations before a proposal is triggered
lookback_months: 12         # rolling window for pattern detection
```

If these fields are absent from `legal-profile/commercial-legal.md`, use the defaults above.

## What it does

### Step 1 — Read the practice profile and log

1. Read `legal-profile/commercial-legal.md` in full. Extract:
   - All current playbook positions for each clause category
   - Playbook monitor settings (threshold and lookback window), or use defaults
   - Notification destination (Slack channel or email from House style section)

2. Read `legal-profile/commercial-legal/deviation-log.yaml`. Filter out:
   - Any entry where `exclude_from_patterns: true`
   - Any entry with `date_signed` outside the configured lookback window

### Step 2 — Detect patterns

For each clause key present in the filtered log, count deviations. Group by:
- Clause (e.g., `limitation_of_liability`)
- Direction of deviation (e.g., "accepted higher cap", "accepted uncapped")
- Basis (e.g., `counterparty_leverage`, `commercial_priority`)

A pattern exists when:
- A single clause has **N or more deviations** within the lookback window, AND
- Those deviations are directionally consistent (same type of concession, not noise in both directions)

If deviations on a clause split roughly equally in both directions, flag as **Inconsistent** — the playbook position may need clarification rather than revision.

If no clause crosses the threshold: log the check to `legal-profile/commercial-legal/playbook-monitor-log.yaml` and stop. Do not notify the attorney.

### Step 3 — Draft proposals

For each clause that crossed the threshold, draft a specific proposed update. Each proposal must include:

1. **The pattern:** what was accepted, how many times, over what period, most common stated basis
2. **Current playbook language** (exact text from `legal-profile/commercial-legal.md`)
3. **Proposed new language** (specific, editable — not "consider revising")
4. **Supporting data:** summary of deviation entries behind the proposal (counterparty, date, basis)
5. **Recommendation:** one of three:
   - **Revise** — practice has consistently exceeded the stated standard; proposed language reflects what actually gets signed
   - **Clarify** — deviations are inconsistent; playbook position needs sharper language, not a different position
   - **Flag for discussion** — deviations may indicate a risk the attorney is normalizing without realizing it; raise before revising

Example proposal block:

```
PROPOSAL 1 OF [N]
Clause: Limitation of Liability
Pattern: Accepted liability cap above 12 months fees in 6 of 8 deals (last 12 months)
Most common basis: Counterparty leverage (4), Commercial priority (2)

Current language in `legal-profile/commercial-legal.md`:
  Standard position: "Mutual cap at 12 months fees paid or payable"
  Acceptable fallbacks: [none listed]

Proposed revision:
  Standard position: "Mutual cap at 12 months fees paid or payable"
  Acceptable fallbacks: "Up to 24 months for enterprise counterparties or anchor clients"
  Never accept: "Uncapped liability"

Supporting deals: Acme Corp MSA (Apr 2026, leverage), Widgetco MSA (Mar 2026, commercial priority), [...]

Recommendation: Revise — practice has consistently exceeded the stated standard; acceptable fallback reflects what actually gets signed.
```

### Step 4 — Write proposals file and notify

Write all proposals to `legal-profile/commercial-legal/playbook-proposals.md`. Overwrite any existing file — stale unreviewed proposals are replaced, not accumulated.

Format:

```markdown
# Playbook Update Proposals
*Generated: [ISO datetime] | [N] proposals | Deviation data through [most recent date_signed in log]*
*To review: run `「review-proposals」工作流（加载 commercial-legal/skills/review-proposals/SKILL.md）`*

---

[Proposal blocks]
```

Notify the attorney via the destination in `legal-profile/commercial-legal.md`:

> Playbook monitor ran — [N] proposed update(s) ready for your review.
> Run `「review-proposals」工作流（加载 commercial-legal/skills/review-proposals/SKILL.md）` when you have a few minutes.
> Proposals: legal-profile/commercial-legal/playbook-proposals.md

Log the run to `legal-profile/commercial-legal/playbook-monitor-log.yaml`:

```yaml
- run_at: [ISO datetime]
  deals_analyzed: [N]
  deals_excluded: [N excluded as one-offs]
  clauses_checked: [N]
  proposals_generated: [N]
  proposals_file: legal-profile/commercial-legal/playbook-proposals.md
```

### Step 5 — Review and approval (triggered by /review-proposals command)

When the attorney runs `「review-proposals」工作流（加载 commercial-legal/skills/review-proposals/SKILL.md）`:

1. Read `legal-profile/commercial-legal/playbook-proposals.md`. If file doesn't exist or is empty: *"No pending proposals. Playbook is up to date."* Stop.

2. Present proposals one at a time:

```
Proposal [N] of [total]: [Clause name]

[Full proposal block as drafted in Step 3]

What would you like to do?
[A] Accept — apply proposed language to `legal-profile/commercial-legal.md`
[R] Reject — keep current language
[E] Edit — I'll type the language I want
[D] Defer — remind me next cycle
```

3. **Accept:** show exact diff before writing:

```
Updating `legal-profile/commercial-legal.md`:

- [current text]
+ [proposed text]

Confirm? (yes / no)
```

   Write only after explicit confirmation.

4. **Edit:** attorney types preferred language. Confirm before writing.

5. **Reject / Defer:** log to `legal-profile/commercial-legal/playbook-monitor-log.yaml` with reason if given. Do not modify `legal-profile/commercial-legal.md`. A rejected proposal is not re-raised until a new pattern emerges after the rejection date.

6. After all proposals resolved, show summary:

```
Review complete.
[N] accepted and applied to `legal-profile/commercial-legal.md`
[N] rejected
[N] deferred to next cycle
[N] edited and applied

`legal-profile/commercial-legal.md` last updated: [timestamp]
Next playbook check: after [N] more deals are logged
```

7. Archive: rename `legal-profile/commercial-legal/playbook-proposals.md` to `legal-profile/commercial-legal/playbook-proposals-[YYYYMMDD].md`. The active file is now clear.

## What this agent does NOT do

- Modify `legal-profile/commercial-legal.md` without explicit per-change attorney confirmation
- Propose updates based on one-off flagged deals (`exclude_from_patterns: true`)
- Treat inconsistent deviation patterns as a revision signal — inconsistency = clarification request
- Generate proposals if no threshold is crossed — silence means the playbook is holding
- Re-raise rejected proposals until a new pattern emerges after the rejection date
- Accumulate stale proposals — each run overwrites the proposals file
